# My very first machine training model using Linear Regression
The accuracy of the model is not that great due to the dataset being extremely small with only about 300 rows and 8 columns and no null values<br>
*Model used: Linear Regression* <br>
*Model imported from : Scikit_Learn* <br><br>
This model is trained on the data which provides information about several features about a car such as the kilometres driven by it, fuel type, etc; and is used to predict the selling price of the car using said features.
